- I changed the title of the web page


- I replaced all the div tags of the HTML page with the below semantic html tags

1.    Header
2.    Nav
3.    Figure
4.    Main
5.    Articles
6.    Aside
7.    Footer


- I changed the last H2 tag to a H4 tag to maintain the sequential order of the heading attributes


- I added accessible alt attributes for all img tags


- In the style.css file I changed the div class to nav to avoid any style changes in the web page.


- I have given comments for all the changes I did in the HTML and CSS file.
