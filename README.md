- I changed the title of the web page


- I replaced all the div tags of the HTML page with the below semantic html tags

1.    Header
2.    Nav
3.    Figure
4.    Main
5.    Articles
6.    Aside
7.    Img Alt
8.    Footer
9.    H4

- In the style.css file I changed the div class to nav to avoid any style changes in the web page.

- I have given comments for all the changes I did in the HTML and CSS file.
